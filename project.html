    <h1>Definition</h1>

Scammers use this method because it is one of the easiest but one of the less effective types of scams.    </p>

The First spam went through wires as early as 1864. The First modern spam was sent from ARPANET, a military-based computer network. The first recorded spam that is known was in 1978 sent by Gary Turk sent 400 people email solicitations about his new line of computers.</p>

    <h6> How does it affect Coding? </h6>
    <p> This affects coders because they can be sent these messages can be sent to them and they are implied to make a machine to block these. This helps everyone by being able to block these messages entirely. Most email companies now intergrate their spam blocker into their app or website.
        sThis helps the online culture by being able to block these messages but these programs aren’t perfect so you have a risk of blocking important emails but this rarely happens. </p>
