    <h4> Four Interesting Facts </h4>
    <p> 1. For every 12.5 million emails that are sent out to people, only one person responds.
        2. 92.4% of malware is delivered through emails.
        3. 76% of businesses claimed to have experienced phishings in 2017.
        4. Since spam is considered as fake messages, people often correlate it to SPAM, the fake meat.

    <h5> What is Spamming? </h5>
    <p> Spamming is a way of scamming people through sending out excessive emails to large amounts of people in order to get them to buy something
        or give out their card/money information.
        There are two types of people:
        1. Normal people who spam to get you to buy their products.
        2. Criminals trying to rob you of your money using identity theft.
    </p>

    <h6> How does it affect Coding? </h6>
    <p> This affects coders because they can be sent these messages can be sent to them and they are implied to make a machine to block these. This helps everyone by being able to block these messages entirely. Most email companies now intergrate their spam blocker into their app or website.
        sThis helps the online culture by being able to block these messages but these programs arenâ€™t perfect so you have a risk of blocking important emails but this rarely happens. </p>
