    <h5> What is Spamming? </h5>
    <p> Spamming is a way of scamming people through sending out excessive emails to large amounts of people in order to get them to buy something
        or give out their card/money information.
        There are two types of people:
        1. Normal people who spam to get you to buy their products.

        sThis helps the online culture by being able to block these messages but these programs arenâ€™t perfect so you have a risk of blocking important emails but this rarely happens. </p>
